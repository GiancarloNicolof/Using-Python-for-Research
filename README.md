# Using Python for Research

HarvardX's PH526x course on edX. Takes during Spring 2024.

**Course description:**  
This course bridges the gap between introductory and advanced courses in Python. While there are many excellent introductory Python courses available, most typically do not go deep enough for you to apply your Python skills to research projects. In this course, after first reviewing the basics of Python 3, we learn about tools commonly used in research settings.

**Topics covered:**
- Python 3 programming basics (a review)
- Python tools for research applications (e.g., NumPy and SciPy modules) 
- How to apply Python research tools in practical settings

The files are organized in 3 main categories:

1. **Homeworks**: solved Homeworks files with their required datasets, divided by Week.
2. **Case Studies**: the Jupyter Notebook files for each case study from Week 03 to Week 05, divided by individual case study.
3. **Final Project**: the final project required to complete the course (work in progress).
4. **Notes**: some notes I took during the lectures of the course.

All the various questions, homeworks and datasets are from the course ending in July 2024.

**Final grades:**
- Homework: 97%
- Comprehension Check: 98%
- Total grade: 83% (out of 85% since the final project is not available for auditors)
